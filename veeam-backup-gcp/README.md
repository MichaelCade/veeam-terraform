# Terraform Sample Code - Veeam Backup for Google Cloud

This folder contains sample code for automating deployment for Veeam Backup for Google Cloud (VBG) using Terraform.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) is a tool for _building_, _changing_, and _versioning_ infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions. There are both [paid and open-source](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing) versions of Terraform.

## üìó Documentation

The code deploys multiple isolated enviroments. Each environment is made of a Veeam Backup for Google Cloud (VBG) instance, a workload VM to protect running WordPress, 2 VPCs and a Google Cloud bucket to store image level backups.

The deployed infrastructure is customizable in the auto.tfvars file, however at a minimum a new VPC for VBG and a VBG instance with public IP will be deployed.

Code uses a signle GCP project and specific limits can be reached while deploying  multiple instance (such as number of VPCs per project).

Usage instructions and details for each sample is located within the respective folder.
